Applied AI Essentials - Hive project in Climate AI

## Project Statement
Solar power will play a major role in a sustainable energy transition. The reliable operation of solar
power plants is critical both in terms of power system safety and economics. The use-case we aim to
solve here is to improve the operational performance of solar modules enabling focused maintenance
and improved efficiency. This is a multi-classification problem using infrared images where we aim to
classify whether a given image belongs to the healthy category or one of the unhealthy ones.
